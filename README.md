## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea

Setting up a notification system within the E-Waste Facility Locator application is essential for keeping users informed about relevant events, drives, and updates related to e-waste recycling facilities. This system serves as a crucial tool in promoting user engagement, encouraging participation in recycling initiatives, and fostering a sense of community involvement in sustainable practices.

The notification system operates by leveraging geolocation services to detect users' proximity to e-waste recycling events, collection drives, and the facilities they frequent. This entails continuously monitoring users' locations and cross-referencing them with event data stored within the application's database. When a user is within the vicinity of a relevant event or drive, the system triggers a notification to alert them in real-time.
